- have npcs welcome you back at mission end
- entire SFX pass for whole project for addactions and hold actions and whatever else you can think of
- change hold action icons for equip scuba gear
- change POW type so it doesnt say co-pilot

- mission fail if friendly fire
- adjust extract heli height cause its glitching
- what to do with pilot or hostage on base return. currently they stay in chopper
- see if smoke can be detected in area marker instead of player
- add game master slot
- condition for stab place bomb for players to be outside
- have npc walk to end of pier and salute as boat drives away.

- Fog never clearing up because forgot to script it that way.
- rework search lumphat. make multiple item searchable and give a percent chance to collect loot from them.
- add photos to victory screens
- beginning jeep needs to move foruther away from players

BUGS:
- couldnt access arsenal at cache one time.
- helicopter kicks me out then hovers up. x 4 (has to do with ai in squad?)
- Some sub tasks are out of there main categories. Resolves on mission restart.
- my computer freezes when entering helo for about 5 seconds.
- couldn't get in boat until other players exited
- missile wont down pilot
- players dont always end up in boat with skip to ingress
- if hvt fail have hq radio players saying they monitor radio traffic and the chicken has 	flown the coup. "see if you can find anything in lumphat at 
your discretion"
- search lumphat optional task doesn't complete
- disable jukebox by looking at the module code in function viewer

JIP ISSUES:
- if a player leaves and he had an ai in his group then no one else can control the AI. The AI becomes invincible. maybe the enable damage reverts? I think
so because this doesnt happen with the POW
- player may not have access to their loadout from the stab if they have scuba equipped and leave and rejoin.
- some combination of JIP players coming and going cause some tasks to cycle through when a player joins. Does not seem to affect the sync of the tasks 
though.
- If a player leaves and his AI is killed its loadout reverts. Face still working tho.

BEFORE PUBLISH:
read description.ext on wiki to polish load screens, etc
- add mission steam main pic (can be any size but must be square. set 1440x1440 in gimp. use square overlay in splendid camera.)
- two more screen shots. approching village and sinlge file jumngle walk space 10 meters apart.
- add autosaves for SP

TO EXPORT FOR PLAY (not testing):
- Change time to night (00:10)
- adjust respawn settings (on custom position and choose the spawn 60secs1)
- enable intro in init.sqf
- make sure player groups call sign is seal team one and all at the start area
- enable damage for command and scout unit
