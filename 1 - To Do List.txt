PRIORITY: FINISH THE MAIN QUEST!
- organize to do in this document

TO DO UP NEXT:
- test new snetry blinds AI, they may spot the boat on the river and ruin a task.
- make subtitles that can be deactivated.
group appears to be in green chat
lots of use of music during cutscnenes
what chat are they using to separate subtitles vs radio subtitles
chat color changed to gold/yellow in the truck. appears to NOT be say3d
- for radio stuff arma plays say3d with the radio playsound. it ends up being nice for immersion like you are hearing on the radio and in real life
- learn to do subtitles like arma main campaign.they are white names instead of blue names.
- hide radio support module in the radio menu as a back up for players when heli fucks them

TO DO AT SOME POINT:
- try addvehicle command to no kick players out of vehicle
- mission fail if friendly fire
- adjust extract heli height cause its glitching
- what to do with pilot or hostage on base return. currently they stay in chopper
- see if smoke can be detected in area marker instead of player
- end mission page to tell players why they died or succeded
- add game master slot
- condition for stab place bomb for players to be outside
- have npc walk to end of pier and salute as boat drives away.
- convert lumphat files to hold actions
- disable the radio after testing because it does help during that.
- BIS_fnc_ambientAnimCombat and another function that does idle stuff in start area.
- how to set server distance view
- record voice actors
- update briefing pics
- write complete script
- have exfil pilots go somewhere after exit
- Fog never clearing up because forgot to script it that way.

BUGS:
- couldnt access arsenal at cache one time.
- helicopter kicks me out then hovers up. x 2
- Some sub tasks are out of there main categories. Resolves on mission restart.
- my computer freezes when entering helo for about 5 seconds.
- couldn't get in boat until other players exited
- missile wont down pilot
- players dont always end up in boat with skip to ingress
- if hvt fail have hq radio players saying they monitor radio traffic and the chicken has 	flown the coup. "see if you can find anything in lumphat at 
your discretion"
- search lumphat optional task doesn't complete
- disable jukebox by looking at the module code in function viewer

JIP ISSUES:
- if a player leaves and he had an ai in his group then no one else can control the AI. The AI becomes invincible. maybe the enable damage reverts? I think
so because this doesnt happen with the POW
- player may not have access to their loadout from the stab if they have scuba equipped and leave and rejoin.
- some combination of JIP players coming and going cause some tasks to cycle through when a player joins. Does not seem to affect the sync of the tasks 
though.
- If a player leaves and his AI is killed its loadout reverts. Face still working tho.

BEFORE PUBLISH:
read description.ext on wiki to polish load screens, etc
- add mission steam main pic (can be any size but must be square. set 1440x1440 in gimp. use square overlay in splendid camera.)
- two more screen shots. approching village and sinlge file jumngle walk space 10 meters apart.
- add autosaves for SP

TO EXPORT FOR PLAY (not testing):
- Change time to night (00:10)
- adjust respawn settings (on custom position and choose the spawn 60secs1)
- enable intro in init.sqf
- make sure player groups call sign is seal team one and all at the start area
- enable damage for command and scout unit
- move pics and sound files back
