TO DO UP NEXT:
- The deactivate mines task didnt create after the boat went by. The wait for patrol taask did finish just fine (the task prior)

- Time of day didnt change after radioing hq
- The naval patrol boat got stuck on the shore but did eventually find its way out. I noticed in zeus that maybe it only had one waypoint to the west. Maybe putting more will help?

- General got in the jeep and tried to flee but I didnt see a patrol spot us. This may be arma behavior because henrys guys shot across the river towards the
back up transports and one of them drove over without loading dudes in the back

- update subtitles in entire mission to include if scout says them with if statements

TO DO AT SOME POINT:
- fill out the prison with prisoners, equipment etc and put hide on it until extract
- add achievements. (perfect mission, 0/10 mission, never spotted, etc)
- have pilots exit heli at missons end
- have npcs welcome you back at mission end
- entire SFX pass for whole project for addactions and hold actions and whatever else you can think of (do this before voices so you can learn the program and workflow)
- change hold action icons for equip scuba gear
- change POW type so it doesnt say co-pilot
- if people think there is too much talking then have an option to reduce it for SP/MP
- try addvehicle command to no kick players out of vehicle
- mission fail if friendly fire
- adjust extract heli height cause its glitching
- what to do with pilot or hostage on base return. currently they stay in chopper
- see if smoke can be detected in area marker instead of player
- add game master slot
- condition for stab place bomb for players to be outside
- have npc walk to end of pier and salute as boat drives away.
- convert lumphat files to hold actions
- disable the radio after testing because it does help during that.
- BIS_fnc_ambientAnimCombat and another function that does idle stuff in start area.
- how to set server distance view
- record voice actors
- update briefing pics
- have exfil pilots go somewhere after exit
- Fog never clearing up because forgot to script it that way.
- add photos to victory screens
- beginning jeep needs to move foruther away from players

BUGS:
- couldnt access arsenal at cache one time.
- Some sub tasks are out of there main categories. Resolves on mission restart.
- couldn't get in boat until other players exited
- players dont always end up in boat with skip to ingress

JIP ISSUES:
- if a player leaves and he had an ai in his group then no one else can control the AI. The AI becomes invincible. maybe the enable damage reverts? I think
so because this doesnt happen with the POW
- player may not have access to their loadout from the stab if they have scuba equipped and leave and rejoin.
- some combination of JIP players coming and going cause some tasks to cycle through when a player joins. Does not seem to affect the sync of the tasks 
though.
- If a player leaves and his AI is killed its loadout reverts. Face still working tho.

BEFORE PUBLISH:
read description.ext on wiki to polish load screens, etc
- add mission steam main pic (can be any size but must be square. set 1440x1440 in gimp. use square overlay in splendid camera.)
- two more screen shots. approching village and sinlge file jumngle walk space 10 meters apart.
- add autosaves for SP

TO EXPORT FOR PLAY (not testing):
- Change time to night (00:10)
- adjust respawn settings (on custom position and choose the spawn 60secs1)
- enable intro in init.sqf
- make sure player groups call sign is Rankin and all at the start area
- enable damage for command and scout unit
- move pics files back

UNTESTED: 
- pow path wasn't enabled after joining. added a sleep before command to see if it works

FINISHED:
- adjusted the order and timings of tasks created at the infil spot
- adjusted task wording for clarity (remain undeteced and kill the HVT)
- fixed issue where "remain undetected" task wouldn't pop up at the correct time. The variable was tied to a 60sec trigger. Had to create a separate trigger so the general and troop transport could
leave at separate times. this also helps with vehicle colisions since they travel the same road.
- polished spotted consequences. How it works currently: If patrol 1-4 sees player then turn on loud speakers and send troop 
transport to patrol road: (PlayersSpotted var). If OPFOR in set area sees player, same as previous sentence AND sends 
troop transport to lumphat AFTER collecting first side mission. Trackers get turned on if any opfor spots players in rectangular area. Once you search the
general I think something happens too but need to look into it.
- Implemented new search for intel task in lumphat. Now there are several items with randomized locations with randomize chance of finding a task on search.

- adjusted naval wait triggers so that you can now fail after passing.
- added fail mission trigger if stab is destroyed before reaching infil point
- added exfil trigger that checks for players in the trigger area and alive and in the extract helicopter
- added pilot trigger that checks for pilot back at base and completes task
