TO DO UP NEXT:
-if players skirt the water and avoid the patrols then the situation can break the mission. the troop transports drive toward the players. crash
on the bridge when they try to return to load up and the general cant flee right.
    option 1: make it so the players cant get to that spot without triggering the fail task
    option 2: move the trucks back further where they wont get shot.
    option 3: disableAi path


BUGS FROM LATEST PLAYTHROUGH:
- Figure out how to proceed with the downed pilot task
    - option 1: make the sam invincible so that the pilot always gets downed.
    - option 2: allow the pilot to be saved a figure a way to deletehim without it messing up anything.
    - option 3: ???
- pow saying sog lines and pilot. pilot was defintley out of the area. and the pow is when underground but i heard him near the lz say stuff too


NEW LINES TO ADD: 
- extraction. lets get the hell out of here as youre holding the action
- c4 hold action. 3.2.1. boom. frenchv ersion for scout


VERIFY NEXT PLAYTHROUGH:
- mercinko should have no questions left. but the way its scripted looks like they still will be there.


TO DO MASTER LIST:
    HIGH PRIORITY:
        - convert lumphat files to hold actions
        - change sabatague icon to destroy and change holdAction from CBA to script. test what happens if you die
        - update subtitles in entire mission to include if scout says them with if statements
            - no subs for captain marchikno
            - before and after radio HQ
            - all naval patrol interactions (3) but the one about suit up for scuba didnt proc at all
            - killed hvt convo
            - spotted by patrol 4 convos (2)
            - all search intel stuff
            - blow c4 cache new lines: fire in the hole. change to hold action?
            - all pow lines
            - comms sabatagued
            - all pilot interactions
            - extraction and smoke
            - rescure pilot
        - entire SFX pass for whole project for addactions and hold actions and whatever else you can think of (do this before voices so you can 
        learn the program and workflow)
        - record voice actors (litterally the last thing youll do, even after the medium/low priority stuff)
    MEDIUM PRIORITY:
        - figure out how you want AI multiplayer to function in your misison:
            - option 1: disable AI. simple?
            - option 2: leave as is but if players leave AI on and dont take group leader then itll be jank.
            - option 3: use select leader and leader changed EH to avoid AI taking control of the AI (what happens if slot one dies and respoawns
                does he get control back?) or some solution that always passes AI to a player
        - there is a locker in lumphat that keeps clipping into the buildings.
        - floating objects in bulding when they are destroyed
        - literally last thing you do maybe because the misisons is always evolving but you need to recheck how the mission performance are working.
            some stuff might have broken.
        - - new line: i see a big ass cache. take what you need then lets blow it.
        - search lumphat should pop-up on infil not mission start
        - picture pass for continuity since there have been changes. includes making pics for death/victory screens
        - fill out the prison with prisoners, equipment etc and put hide on it until extract
        - add achievements. (perfect mission, 0/10 mission, never spotted, etc)
        - add game master slot
        - condition for stab place bomb for players to be outside
        - beginning jeep needs to move foruther away from players
    LOW PRIORITY:
        - if you put on an enemy back pack you get to know if you are being tracked and what the state of things are
        - BIS_fnc_ambientAnimCombat and another function that does idle stuff in start area.
        - disable the squad radio cahtter. Keep for now testing because it does help during that. Chance that this breaks something though.
        - adjust extract heli height cause its glitching
        - have pilots, pow, downed pilot exit heli at missons end
        - have npcs welcome you back at mission end
        - have npc walk to end of pier and salute as boat drives away.
        - if people think there is too much talking then have an option to reduce it for SP/MP
        - mission fail if friendly fire
        - see if smoke can be detected in area marker instead of player


TOUGH BUGS:
- try addvehicle command to no kick players out of vehicle (not verified since waypoints rework of helicopter extraction)
- scout wont get in the stab
- couldnt access arsenal at cache one time.
- Some sub tasks are out of there main categories. Resolves on mission restart.
- couldn't get in boat until other players exited
- players dont always end up in boat with skip to ingress

    JIP ISSUES:
        - if a player leaves and he had an ai in his group then no one else can control the AI. The AI becomes invincible. maybe the enable damage reverts? I think
        so because this doesnt happen with the POW
        - player may not have access to their loadout from the stab if they have scuba equipped and leave and rejoin.
        - some combination of JIP players coming and going cause some tasks to cycle through when a player joins. Does not seem to affect the sync of the tasks 
        though.
        - If a player leaves and his AI is killed its loadout reverts. Face still working tho.


BEFORE YOU PUBLISH:
read description.ext on wiki to polish load screens, etc
- add mission steam main pic (can be any size but must be square. set 1440x1440 in gimp. use square overlay in splendid camera.)
- two more screen shots. approching village and sinlge file jumngle walk space 10 meters apart.
- add autosaves for SP


TO EXPORT FOR PLAY TESTING ON DEDICATED SERVER:
- Change time to night (00:10)
- adjust respawn settings (on custom position and choose the spawn 60secs1)
- enable intro in init.sqf
- make sure player groups call sign is Rankin and all at the start area
- enable damage for command and scout unit
- move pics files back


FINISHED:
- completely reworked the way that side tasks are picked and completed, to allow for completion before pickup. i added functions for the lines so 
the hold action is more readable. added more voice lines for certain conditions
- deleted rankin easter egg
- Emptied the pows inventroy
- fixed bug, all patrols spotted player while he was far away. Maybe AI shares info with each other? Removed event handler fromm all patrols after first use.
- fixed fog not clearing after 5 minutes at the infil
- changed hold action icons for equip scuba gear to better fit visual continuity
- changed POW type so it says driver to fit the narritive better
- adjusted codex for clarity.
- fixed time of day and weather not changing on dedicated server. Had to remoteExec them to get them to work.
- reworked the patrol boat tasks in the beginning of the mission to flow better and make more sense.
- adjusted the order and timings of tasks created at the infil spot
- adjusted task wording for clarity (remain undeteced and kill the HVT)
- fixed issue where "remain undetected" task wouldn't pop up at the correct time. The variable was tied to a 60sec trigger. Had to create a separate trigger so the general and troop transport could
leave at separate times. this also helps with vehicle colisions since they travel the same road.
- polished spotted consequences. How it works currently: If patrol 1-4 sees player then turn on loud speakers and send troop 
transport to patrol road: (PlayersSpotted var). If OPFOR in set area sees player turn on tracker and sends troop transport to lumphat after players fined
one side mission. Once you search the general no reinforcements come. General flees after 60sec (var playersspotted) if any patrol sees players.
If the patrols see the boat because it was destroyed then general flees after 60 secs.
- Implemented new search for intel task in lumphat. Now there are several items with randomized locations with randomize chance of finding a task on search.
