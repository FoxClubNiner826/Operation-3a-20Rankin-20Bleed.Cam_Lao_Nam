Achievements are disabled by default.<br/><br/>
It’s recommended to play with them off for your first run, as many achievements contain spoilers. 
Their titles are intentionally vague to reduce this, but some hints still remain.<br/><br/>
You can enable achievements by interacting with the map board next to the arsenal.<br/><br/>
This is a global effect, meaning it applies to all players in the mission.

3D task markers are disabled by default.<br/><br/>
This mission was designed to encourage players to use their orientation skills. By default, Arma 3 places 3D task markers in both the world and the map.  
Although the game difficulty option Waypoints can disable markers in the world, it does not affect the map. 
This means objectives that are meant to be searched for are still revealed, which undermines the challenge.<br/><br/>  
If you don’t want to focus on orientation skills, you can enable 3D task markers to make objectives easy to find.<br/><br/>

You can enable them by interacting with the map board next to the arsenal.<br/><br/>

This is a global effect, meaning the setting will apply to every player in the mission.
